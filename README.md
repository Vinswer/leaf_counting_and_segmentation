# leaf_counting_and_segmentation

*A complete implementation for CNN-based leaf counting and object detection using Arabidopsis datasets.*

## Overview
This repository implements two complementary tasks in digital plant phenotyping:

**1. Leaf Counting** – Regression-based CNN models to predict the number of leaves per plant.  
**2. Leaf Detection** – Object detection models to locate and evaluate individual leaves.

The project is based on the **Leaf Segmentation Challenge (LSC)** and **Leaf Counting Challenge (LCC)** datasets of *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Tobacco* plants.
